The Keyestudio Water Sensor you're using is a digital water detection sensor, not an analog one. It typically has 3 pins labeled:

Label	Description
S	Signal (Digital OUT)
+	VCC (Power)
‚Äì	GND

‚úÖ What This Means
The sensor outputs HIGH (1) when no water is detected, and LOW (0) when water is present.

It can be connected directly to a GPIO pin (no MCP3008 needed).

# üß∞ Setup Instructions (Keyestudio Water Sensor ‚Üí Raspberry Pi 4)
Sensor Pin	Connect To Raspberry Pi
S (Signal)	GPIO17 (Pin 11)
+ (VCC)	3.3V (Pin 1)
‚Äì (GND)	GND (Pin 6)

‚úÖ You can use any GPIO, but this code example uses GPIO17.

# üêç Python Code Example (digital_water_sensor.py)

bash```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Use BCM pin numbering
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Set the GPIO pin connected to the signal pin of the sensor
WATER_SENSOR_PIN = 17

# Set pin as input
GPIO.setup(WATER_SENSOR_PIN, GPIO.IN)

print("üåä Monitoring water level (CTRL+C to stop)...")

try:
    while True:
        if GPIO.input(WATER_SENSOR_PIN) == GPIO.LOW:
            print("üíß Water detected!")
        else:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è No water detected.")
        time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nStopped by user.")
    GPIO.cleanup()
```
